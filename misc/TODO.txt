- plot gp data on map programatically
- plot gpx data with uncertainty
 
 - readme.md: https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme
 - test suite
   - folder not found
   - folder found but empty
   - ambiguous folder
   
 - analysis
   - pct acceptable
   - l1 vs l2 on calibration
   - polynomial interpolation?
   - vif, residual plot
   - gen assumptions needed for lin reg
   
 
 x compare local and gcloud gpx files
 x handle negative elevation in exif
 x validate against wristwatch GPS
 x sync date
 x check for empty folder on gcloud
 x adjust for local vs UTC time
 
 x calibrate btw watch and photo
   x interpolate watch to second accuracy
   x for each offset from -15 sec to + 15 sec: calculate MSE for all photos
   x print MSE
   x negative time delta
 
 x implement decimal for precision
